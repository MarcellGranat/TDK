# TDK template

Welcome to the Scientific Student Conference (TDK) Template Repository! This GitHub repository contains a ready-to-use template for preparing and submitting your papers for the Scientific Student Conference. The template is designed to make your submission process smooth and hassle-free.

This template enables you to use the simple markdown syntax. We prepared a minimalistic document with examples how to do that, but you can find further examples at <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html>.

## How to start?

1.  Install quarto in R

```{r}
install.packages("quarto")
```

2.  Activate this template from the terminal. In Rstudio: open terminal the terminal & type:

```{quarto use template MarcellGranat/TDK}
```

3.  Open a new .qmd file (file \> new file \> Quarto Document)

4.  Fill out the yaml as in the [template.qmd](https://github.com/MarcellGranat/TDK/template.qmd)

If you write your paper in english (congrats and keep up the good work!), use \`TDKen-pdf\` instead of `TDK-pdf` as format
